# Common issues
Greatest foes:
- First round boss can have disappearing effects on clients.

Dark Menace:
- Final round boss can cause crashes at random or have disappearing effects on clients.

- While 3 slots commands can be used, be wary that they can cause random crashes due to extra RAM being used.

- Network desynchronizations can end up in bosses behaving incorrectly (sometimes making them harder because of it).

- During Ultimate Duo, No Heart can take a while to begin moving.
