# Birth by Sleep Final Mix Superboss Mod
PSP emulator with a patch to fight superbosses.

First you need to apply the patch to your ISO. This can be applied to translated ISO or a clean one.
In order to check if your Translated ISO is patchable, check if the ISO's MD5 checksum matches your ISO.
There are several versions of the translated ISO on the internet, so yours might not be patchable. I personally recommend a clean untranslated ISO.
A recommended tool to check MD5 checksum is in this website: https://www.winmd5.com/

> MD5 checksum Clean ISO:

> MD5 checksum Translated ISO:
> d736815b63a36be721e674c278cbd658

Now, just use xDelta GUI added to this repository to patch your ISO with the corresponding patch.
